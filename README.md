📊 Data Science Projects (Google Colab Notebooks)
Overview

This repository contains a compilation of my data science projects developed using Google Colab, covering the period from April to date. The notebooks document my learning journey, practical experimentation, and applied projects across various areas of data science and analytics.

Each notebook is self-contained and includes code, explanations, and outputs where applicable.

📁 Repository Structure

The repository consists mainly of Jupyter/Colab notebooks (.ipynb), each focusing on a specific concept, dataset, or problem. Typical contents include:

Data loading and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Data visualization

Statistical analysis

Machine learning models

Model evaluation and interpretation

🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

Across the notebooks, the following skills and tools are applied:

Programming: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Techniques:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis

Supervised learning

Model training and evaluation

Basic predictive modeling

🚀 How to Use This Repository

Browse the notebooks directly on GitHub or

Open them in Google Colab:

Click on a notebook

Select “Open in Colab” (or upload manually)

Run the cells sequentially to reproduce results

Most notebooks are designed to run independently and include necessary explanations.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Showcase practical data science skills

Track learning progress over time

Serve as a portfolio for internships, research, or entry-level roles

Provide reference material for future projects

📌 Notes

Datasets used may be public, synthetic, or educational in nature

Some notebooks may represent experiments or work-in-progress ideas

Improvements and refactoring may occur over time
