But small galaxies form stars too, like irregular dwarf galaxy Sextans A. Its young star clusters and star forming regions are gathered into a gumdrop-shaped region a mere 5,000 light-years across. Seen toward the navigational constellation Sextans, the small galaxy lies some 4.5 million light-years distant. That puts it near the outskirts of the local group of galaxies, that includes the large, massive spirals Andromeda and our own Milky Way. Brighter Milky Way foreground stars appear spiky and yellowish in this colorful telescopic view of Sextans A.\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\u003cimg src=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/sexa_gemsbock_cdk_pub1024.jpg\"/\u003e"],"text/plain":["\u003cIPython.core.display.Image object\u003e"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["CSV file 'asteroid_data.csv' created successfully.\n"]}],"source":["import requests\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Replace with your own API key from https://api.nasa.gov\n","API_KEY = 'BjlC2FepL2DuJ30grrSeTz3shCtIAtyEDgY3Bh0d'\n","\n","# APOD endpoint\n","apod_url = f'https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={API_KEY}'\n","\n","# Request the image metadata\n","apod_response = requests.get(apod_url).json()\n","\n","# Display image and metadata\n","from IPython.display import Image, display\n","\n","print(\"Title:\", apod_response['title'])\n","print(\"Date:\", apod_response['date'])\n","print(\"Explanation:\", apod_response['explanation'])\n","\n","# Show image\n","display(Image(url=apod_response['url']))\n","\n","# Example date range to search\n","neo_url = f'https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed?start_date=2024-01-01\u0026end_date=2024-01-02\u0026api_key={API_KEY}'\n","\n","# Get asteroid data\n","neo_response = requests.get(neo_url).json()\n","neo_data = neo_response['near_earth_objects']\n","\n","# Flatten the JSON\n","asteroids_list = []\n","for date in neo_data:\n","    for asteroid in neo_data[date]:\n","        asteroids_list.append({\n","            'Asteroid ID': asteroid['id'],\n","            'Asteroid name': asteroid['name'],\n","            'Minimal estimated diameter (km)': asteroid['estimated_diameter']['kilometers']['estimated_diameter_min'],\n","            'Absolute_magnitude': asteroid['absolute_magnitude_h'],\n","            'Relative_velocity(km/s)': float(asteroid['close_approach_data'][0]['relative_velocity']['kilometers_per_second'])\n","        })\n","\n","# Convert to DataFrame\n","df = pd.DataFrame(asteroids_list)\n","df.head()\n","\n","# Rename columns for cleaner output\n","df.columns = [\n","    'Asteroid ID',\n","    'Asteroid name',\n","    'Minimal estimated diameter (km)',\n","    'Absolute magnitude',\n","    'Relative velocity (km/s)'\n","]\n","\n","# View cleaned DataFrame\n","df.head()\n","\n","df.to_csv('asteroid_data.csv', index=False)\n","print(\"CSV file 'asteroid_data.csv' created successfully.\")\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPIqVdlvK9W6xoL/MpuIOU+","name":"","version":""},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
